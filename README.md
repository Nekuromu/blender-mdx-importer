## Blender WarCraft 3 .mdx importer

This is an addon for [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) that allows you to import `.mdx` models and animations from the game `WarCraft 3`.

The addon will work in `Blender` `4.5.4 LTS`.

This is a fork of [PavelBlends](https://github.com/PavelBlend/Blender_WarCraft-3) version, that only supported Blender 2.79
